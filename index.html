          <h3>Dry Rosogolla</h3>
          <p>
            Rosogolla is a South Asian syrupy dessert popular in the Indian
            subcontinent and regions with South Asian diaspora. It is made from
            ball-shaped dumplings of chhena (an Indian cottage cheese) and
            semolina dough, cooked in light syrup made of sugar. This is done
            until the syrup permeates the dumplings.

          <h3>Dry Lalmohon</h3>
          <p>
            The fame of the sweets of the old shop is spread over the khulna
            district. A special type of pantoa with special taste is found here.
            Many people run to the shop to take the taste of hot sweet as the
            Ambassador of the United States went there. Sweet is served in a
            different style in this shop. No spoon is given with the plate of
            sweet. Pantoa, rosogolla and sandesh are served in a banana leaf
            placing on the plate. The hand is used to taste sweet. Miller, the
            ambassador could not deny the custom. He tasted the taste on 12th
            February 2019 along with his followers. The sweets gave him amazing
            taste and he carried rosogolla and pantoa with him. His wife
            accompanied him. She also praised the taste of the sweets.

          <h3>Gulab Jumn</h3>
          <p>
            Gulab jamun (also spelled gulaab jamun) is a milk-solid-based sweet,
            originating in Medieval Iran.[1] and a type of mithai, popular in
            India, Nepal, Pakistan, the Maldives (where it is known as gulab ki
            janu), and Bangladesh (where it is known as golap jam), as well as
            Myanmar. It is also common in nations with substantial populations
            of people with South Asian heritage, such as Mauritius, Fiji, the
            Malay Peninsula, Great Britain, South Africa, and the Caribbean
            countries of Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, and Suriname. It
            is made mainly from milk solids, traditionally from khoya, which is
            milk reduced to the consistency of a soft dough. Modern recipes call
            for dried or powdered milk instead of khoya. It is often garnished
            with dried nuts such as almonds and cashews to enhance flavour. 25th
            of May is celebrated as world Gulab jamun Day.
